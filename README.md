# Plant Disease Detection using PyTorch, Flask, and Streamlit

This project aims to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques implemented with PyTorch. It provides both a web application built with Flask for real-time detection and a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit for offline analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Hugging Face: [Plant Disease Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/khushwant04/Plant-Disease-Dataset)

## Docker Image
You can find the Docker image containing the complete working environment and application at Docker Hub: [Plant Disease Detection Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/khushwant04/plant-disease/)

## Features
- Utilizes PyTorch and torchvision for training and deploying deep learning models.
- Provides a Flask API for real-time inference.
- Offers a Streamlit web application for offline analysis and visualization.
- Supports a wide range of plant diseases for accurate detection.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khushwant04/plant-disease-detection.git

2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. streamlit run main.py
